## Overview
This file explains the most common Git commands beginners need to:
- install and check Git,
- configure identity on their machine,
- initialize a repo, and
- push code to GitHub.

Commands are shown in code blocks â€” replace placeholders (like your username or repo URL) before running them.

---

## Quick checks
Run these to confirm Git is installed and which version:
```bash
git -v
```

---

## Configure Git (one-time on your machine)
Set your Git identity so commits are attributed to you. Replace the placeholders with your GitHub values:

```bash
git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

Check what you've set:
```bash
git config --list
```

(Optional) Use the credential helper so Git can remember your credentials:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
# or use 'cache' (temporary) on some systems:
# git config --global credential.helper cache
```

---

## Add your project to Git and push to GitHub
These commands assume you are in your project directory.

1) Initialize a local repository:
```bash
git init
```

2) Stage all files:
```bash
git add .
```

3) Create your first commit (replace the message with something descriptive):
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: add project files"
```

4) Ensure the main branch name is `main`:
```bash
git branch -M main
```

5) Link your local repo to the GitHub repository (replace the URL with your repo URL):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

6) Verify the remote:
```bash
git remote -v
```

7) Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Notes:
- If Git prompts for credentials, use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (PAT) if password auth is disabled.
- If the remote repo already has commits, you may need to pull first or force a safe merge.

---

## Common tips & troubleshooting
- "Permission denied" or authentication errors: create a PAT on GitHub and use it instead of a password, or set up SSH keys.
- Forgot to include a file? Add it and run:
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  git commit -m "Add missing file"
  git push
  ```
- Want to see commit history:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --graph --decorate
  ```
- To undo the last commit but keep changes staged:
  ```bash
  git reset --soft HEAD~1
  ```
  Use with care â€” learn what reset/checkout do before using them.
